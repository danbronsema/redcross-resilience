<p>The REDiPlan Partnership with Councils project is being rolled out across the Onkaparinga and Mt Barker councils. Our work also continues in the Adelaide Hills council to deliver the REDiPlan program through informative seminars and home visits.</p>

<p>This project targets the most vulnerable people in our communities including seniors, people with disabilities, carers, and others who want assistance in preparing for emergencies.</p>

<p>In a REDiPlan session, people discuss simple steps to improve their preparedness, such as keeping a wind-up radio handy and knowing their neighbourâ€™s phone number.</p>

<p>As REDiPlan looks at all hazards, the focus ranges from natural disasters to personal emergencies like the unplanned trip to hospital.</p>

<p>Interested volunteers are trained to run REDiPlan sessions on emergency preparedness, and distribute materials to vulnerable people in the community.</p>

<p>If you would like to inquire about holding a session or may be interested in becoming a Community Speaker, please contact Emina Allegretti on 8100 4588, or email <a>eallegretti@redcross.org.au</a></p>
