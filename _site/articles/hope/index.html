<p>In the aftermath of Queenslandâ€™s ex-Tropical Cyclone Oswald, South Australia deployed 31 Emergency Services people (17 staff and 14 volunteers) to support those affected by floodwaters.</p>

<p>Our SA people worked in key roles ranging from Commander, State Operations Officer and Deputy Logistics Officer based in Brisbane, to key field operational positions at evacuation and recovery centres.</p>

<p>Outreach was also conducted within affected communities in and around Bundaberg which was isolated and greatly impacted by floodwaters.</p>

<p>An Indigenous team was deployed consisting of three Red Cross staff to work as Cultural Liaison Officers and assist with local recovery efforts. Over 2,000 REDi Teddies were distributed to children to provide comfort.</p>

<p>Feedback from organisers in Queensland has been particularly favourable and complimentary of the contribution South Australian staff and volunteers have made.</p>
