<p>Aboriginal REDiSupport is a Red Cross Emergency Services program that engages local community members and equips them with skills to prepare for, and recover from, emergencies.</p>

<p>The project was formed as part of a response to the increasing number of emergencies occurring in South Australia’s regional areas, and to meet the cultural needs of communities locally, state-wide and nationally.</p>

<p>The current project builds on the successful Port Augusta REDiSupport pilot project, and will establish Aboriginal REDiSupport teams in the Lower Eyre Peninsula and the Flinders Ranges areas.</p>

<p>Aboriginal communities on Lower Eyre Peninsula and Flinders Ranges are vulnerable to a range of hazards such as bushfires, storms, heatwaves and flooding. Recent history has shown these communities and their resources are particularly vulnerable to bushfire.</p>

<p>The REDiSupport Project aims to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Train local Aboriginal people to form an Emergency Services Response Team, named REDiSupport;</li>

<li>Improve the community’s ability to prepare for, and recover from, an emergency</li>

<li>Develop South Australia’s capacity to support Aboriginal communities in times of emergency, and provide support to other States and Territories.</li>
</ul>
