<p>Findon High School students and teachers invited Red Cross to collect some blankets which had been knitted in time for winter.</p>

<p>The knitting was a project that junior students undertook because senior students were able to donate blood, while the junior students were too young to do so.</p>

<p>However, this did not stop the junior students from finding other ways to help Red Cross.</p>

<p>It became a community effort with a lot of donations of wool and needles and many family members knitting squares.</p>

<p>Donated blankets are used during emergencies or may provide warmth during winter for clients in need.</p>
