<p>Regional volunteers across South Australia have been recruited and trained to assist our team in delivering emergency services training.</p>

<p>The Emergency Services team is working closely with the regional trainers to prepare training plans and begin delivering regional training from August to November in preparation for the upcoming peak activation season.</p>

<p>If you have had previous experience as a trainer, a lecturer, teacher or presenter, and would like to assist Emergency Services, please contact Chris Keenihan on 8100 4637, 0418 823 529 or <a>ckeenihan@redcross.org.au</a>.</p>
