Aboriginal REDiSupport is a Red Cross Emergency Services program that engages local community members and equips them with skills to prepare for, and recover from, emergencies.

The project was formed as part of a response to the increasing number of emergencies occurring in South Australia’s regional areas, and to meet the cultural needs of communities locally, state-wide and nationally.

The current project builds on the successful Port Augusta REDiSupport pilot project, and will establish Aboriginal REDiSupport teams in the Lower Eyre Peninsula and the Flinders Ranges areas. 

Aboriginal communities on Lower Eyre Peninsula and Flinders Ranges are vulnerable to a range of hazards such as bushfires, storms, heatwaves and flooding. Recent history has shown these communities and their resources are particularly vulnerable to bushfire. 

The REDiSupport Project aims to:
 - Train local Aboriginal people to form an Emergency Services Response Team, named REDiSupport;
 - Improve the community’s ability to prepare for, and recover from, an emergency
 - Develop South Australia’s capacity to support Aboriginal communities in times of emergency, and provide support to other States and Territories.
