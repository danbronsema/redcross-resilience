On Tuesday 7th May, Red Cross Emergency Services staff and volunteers participated in a mock tornado scenario, together with over 90 Year 4 students at Nazareth Catholic College.

The school oval was strewn with debris from the ‘tornado’ that had swept through leaving rubbish, casualties and distressed parents in its wake.
All emergency service agencies were invited to participate in the scenario to help students learn about the important role that agencies play in response to an incident or disaster.

Students were divided between the four agencies, to carry out essential roles required during the response.

Red Cross’ students were given the role of providing personal support to affected people, as well as completing forms to register inquiries about missing people.

The exercise was planned well and proved to be a good way to learn about emergency response and the important work that all our agencies do.
