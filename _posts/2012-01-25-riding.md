title: Findon High School - blankets for warmth 
intro: In April, two young people from the Hill House in Rutherford, New South Wales, commenced volunteer work with Riding for the Disabled. The young people volunteer for a three hour shift once a fortnight. This has provided a great opportunity for these young people to gain skills while engaging with members of the community.

Findon High School students and teachers invited Red Cross to collect some blankets which had been knitted in time for winter.

The knitting was a project that junior students undertook because senior students were able to donate blood, while the junior students were too young to do so.

However, this did not stop the junior students from finding other ways to help Red Cross.

It became a community effort with a lot of donations of wool and needles and many family members knitting squares.

Donated blankets are used during emergencies or may provide warmth during winter for clients in need.
